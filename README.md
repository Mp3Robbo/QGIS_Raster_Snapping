This snaps one raster to another in QGIS

CAUTION: This is current just a first pass, it will only work where
1. The top left corner of the raster to be snapped is within the extent of the raster to be snapped to
2. The coordinate systems of the two tifs are identical
3. The pixel sizes of the tifs are identical

This could definitely be improved, and if you have improved code please put it in the issues or discussion section
